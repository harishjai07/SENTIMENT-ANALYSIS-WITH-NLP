# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-WITH-NLP

DURATION: 4 WEEEKS

DESCRIPTION: My second task is Sentiment Analysis with NLP, where I analyze text data to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. I implemented this using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text, extract meaningful features, and train a model for sentiment classification. I ran the code in Google Colab, ensuring it executed correctly and provided accurate sentiment predictions. To maintain proper documentation and version control, I uploaded the code to GitHub, along with relevant outputs showcasing the sentiment classification results. This task helped me understand text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization, along with the implementation of machine learning models for text-based predictions. Running the analysis in Google Colab allowed me to leverage cloud resources efficiently, and by storing everything on GitHub, I ensured easy access, collaboration, and tracking of modifications for future improvements and debugging.
